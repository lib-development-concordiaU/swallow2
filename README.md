# Swallow2
General purpose version of the original Swallow Metadata Management System.

The most distinctive characteristic of the Swallow architecture is the decoupling of the metadata schema from the database. This is possible by storing the metadata information in no-SQL format and implementing an engine to generate the user interface from a configuration files.

## Installation 
1. Create a mysql database and run the script located on the DB Script Folder. This creates the initial structure. Please note that this also creates an admin user, which you should re-intialize with a new password using the interface.

2. Follow the instructions on the [configuration section](https://github.com/lib-development-concordiaU/swallow2/wiki/2.-Configuration#database-and-other-configurations) located on the Wiki to configure the database and the schema definition files.
